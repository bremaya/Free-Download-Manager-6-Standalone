# Free-Download-manager-6-Standalone

Free Download Manager (FDM) (https://www.freedownloadmanager.org) is a free Internet download manager and optimizer. It's a powerful modern download accelerator and organizer for Windows and others systems.

This is a personal project, and I'm not related with SoftDeluxe Team (https://www.freedownloadmanager.org) or PortableApps (https://portableapps.com).
Only unpack and enjoy (unpack in PortableApps folder to integrate with him).

This is packed with Free Download Manager v6.16.1.4558 (1dc2b27) 32 and 64 bit.

If there is an error with the integration extension of Free Download Manager (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/free-download-manager/ahmpjcflkgiildlgicmcieglgoilbfdp), disable and reactivate the extension after opening the free download manager.
